This project has as its aim implementing a music visualizer and equalizer.

To visualize the music, STFT will be used.

To equalize, we will try stuff out.

We will start out with python and try porting it to C++, and finally to C.

We will use python libs for cheating on the beginning, and afterwards implement each method by hand.
